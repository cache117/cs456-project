# Social Journal

A common problem that we've found with Millenials (and others as well), is that many of them have trouble keeping a journal. This app attempts to solve that problem. 
Many millennials use social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram. This means that they are already journaling to an extent. They have documented aspects of their lives with pretty great detail.
Enter Social Journal. This application downloads the posts from Facebook and Instagram so that all of the users' posts are in one place.
